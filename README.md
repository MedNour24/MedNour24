Hey there! 👋

I'm Med, a computer science student based in Tunisia.

I love building things on the web and exploring anything related to AI, code, and digital tech.

If a project idea hits me, I usually end up coding it, testing it, breaking it, and rebuilding it better.

My main tech stack:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, C, C++
I enjoy clean code, algorithms, and anything that challenges my brain.

I’ve got a few projects pinned — and many more still in progress or waiting to be shipped.

If you’re curious about what I’m learning or building, feel free to explore my repos!
